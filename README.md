## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (version x.x.x)
- PostgreSQL (version x.x.x)
- npm or Yarn package manager
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required packages.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:

   - Create a PostgreSQL database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
     ```

4. **Run migrations**:

   Run the migration files to set up the database schema. Ensure you have a migration tool installed (e.g., Knex, Sequelize) or follow specific instructions for your migration setup.

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. **Seed the database** (optional):

   If you want to populate your database with initial data, run the seed command:

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

6. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required packages.

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

7. **Configure environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your PostgreSQL database connection string and any other environment variables:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
   PORT=5000
   ```

   Adjust the variables as necessary for your setup.

## Usage

1. **Start the backend server**:

   In the `backend` directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Start the frontend client**:

   In the `frontend` directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The client will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Access the application**:

   You can now access the web application in your browser. [Include any additional instructions for interacting with the app.]

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/products` - Fetch all productss
- `POST /api/products` - Create a new products
- `POST /api/products/review/:id` - Create a new product review
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Fetch a products by ID
- `PUT /api/products/:id` - Update a products by ID
- `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Delete a products by ID

## Database Schema

[Provide a brief description of the database schema and its relationships. You can include diagrams or tables if needed.]

## Seeding and Migrations

### Migrations

The migrations are located in the `backend/migrations` directory. They set up the initial database schema. To run the migrations, use:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

### Seeders

Seeders are located in the `backend/seeders` directory and are used to populate the database with initial data. To run the seeders, use:

```bash
npm run seed
```

## Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL: For the database
- Express.js: For building the server
- React.js: For the front-end UI
